# URL - SHORTENER
Link Shortening Service

This project is a URL Shortener built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a custom Python Flask API with database integration.

Users can enter long URLs and receive unique shortened links. The backend, fully developed from scratch, handles URL generation, link storage in a database, and exposes a REST API for communication with the frontend.

The project demonstrates full-stack development skills, covering frontend design, API creation, and database management.

To use it, just open the "start.bat" file , and go to **https://127.0.0.1:5000** 

I'm gonna try to update the frontend to optmize and looks better.

This is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!!
